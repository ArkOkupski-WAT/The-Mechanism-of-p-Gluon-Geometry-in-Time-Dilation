# The-Mechanism-of-p-Gluon-Geometry-in-Time-Dilation
A philosophical-speculative model unifying relativistic and gravitational time dilation through p-gluon geometry deformation. Proposes Z2 fastener phase transitions, predicts no spaghettification in neutron star mergers (GW170817), and eliminates black hole singularities via fundamental compression limits.
